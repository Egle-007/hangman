## About the project 

*Hangman* is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This project is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer picks a random word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Rules of the game 

    1. In the beggining of the game a player has 5 lives.
    2. A player guesses a letter: 
        - If letter is correct, it is replaces a dash(-es) on the hidden word.
        - If it doesn't match any of the letters in the hidden word, a player then loses a life.
    4. If a player has no lives left, the game is lost.
    5. If all letters are rewealed before a player loses the lives - game is won.
